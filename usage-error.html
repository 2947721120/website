Hey guys, Cloudflare has recently had to limit ICMP packets which has affected our monitoring service.   The CDN itself has had no network issues.
<br />
<br />
To solve this, we've changed the way we monitor.   We now perform HTTP checks instead of PING checks by loading a real file from the CDN (http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/html5shiv/3.6.1/html5shiv.js).   We've also changed to HTTP monitoring for the website.
<br />
<br />
In summary, the CDN has been rock solid and our uptime monitoring will now much more accurately affect what is actually happening.
