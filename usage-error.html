Hey guys, recently we have been having problems with our monitoring service.   The CDN itself has had no network issues but the DNS monitoring is recording bad data.
<br />
<br />
We will keep you guys posted but again the CDN itself has had no down time and no one has reported any breakages.
<br />
<br />
We have left up the monitoring service results for now
<br />
